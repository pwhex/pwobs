The typing story

In a conversation today about 'Who do you think is the fastest typer in the lab?', Aria and Soumya responded- "Oh Juliana is the fastest typer. She types so fast."

Is she really fast? I also think she is. But how fast is she really is? I'm curious to know.


Remember, to know and not to do is really not to know.
This quote suggests that knowledge alone is not enough. **True understanding** and **practical application** are what truly matter. If you know something but don't put it into practice, it's as if you don't know it at all. This quote emphasizes the importance of taking action and applying knowledge in real-life situations to truly learn and grow.

Newton's quote:
'I don't know what I may appear to the world, but to myself, I seem to have been only like a boy, playing on the sea shore. Diverting myself by now and then finding a smoother pebble or prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth layed all undiscovered before me.'
