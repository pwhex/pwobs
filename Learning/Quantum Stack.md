A **quantum stack** is a conceptual framework or architecture that layers the key components of a quantum computing system, similar to the classical computing stack but tailored for quantum technologies. Here's a simplified breakdown:

1. **Quantum Algorithms & Applications**
    - Top layer: High-level algorithms (e.g., Shor's, Grover's) and use cases (chemistry, optimization).
2. **Quantum Software**
    - Compilers, programming languages (Q#, Cirq, Qiskit), and error mitigation tools.
3. **Quantum Error Correction**
    - Mid-layer: Logical qubits protected by error-correcting codes (e.g., surface codes).
4. **Quantum Hardware**
    - Physical qubits (superconducting, trapped ions, photonic, etc.) and control electronics.
5. **Classical Control & Infrastructure**
    - Base layer: Classical systems for qubit control, cooling (cryogenics), and interfacing.
### Purpose:
The stack abstracts complexity, enabling progress at each layer (e.g., better algorithms or hardware) to advance the entire system toward practical quantum computing. Challenges include error rates, scalability, and integration between layers.
