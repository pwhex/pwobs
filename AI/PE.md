**Prompt engineering** is the process of crafting and refining prompts to improve the performance of generative AI models.

**Why prompt engineering**
- Improves the accuracy and relevance of AI outputs
- Enables users to structure queries that better unlock an AI's capabilities
- Helps bridge the gap between vague, general queries and specific, targeted outputs
- Reduces the risk of prompt injection attacks and ensures model outputs align with desired ethical and operational standards

A **prompt** is an input or instruction provided to an AI model to generate a response. Prompts can take many forms, from simple questions to more complex instructions that specify tone, style, or structure.

## Types of Prompting

8. Instruction prompting: Giving instructions in natural langugage
9. Assiging roles: assume you are a mathmatician. Do this.
10. Prompt Chaining
	1. Chain of Thoughts
	2. Tree of thoughts
11. Meta prompting
12. shot based prompting: In-Context Learning is closely tied to the concept of **shot-based prompting methods**, where **"shots"** refer to the number of examples included in the prompt.
	1. zero shot: No examples are provided, and the model must rely entirely on its pre-trained knowledge.
	2. one shot: - A single example is given to clarify the task for the model.
	3. [Few-Shot Prompting](https://learnprompting.org/docs/basics/few_shot#what-is-few-shot-prompting): Two or more examples are included, allowing the model to recognize patterns and deliver more accurate responses.



```
Classify the sentiment of the following text as positive, negative, or neutral.

Text: The product is terrible. Sentiment: Negative

Text: Super helpful, worth it Sentiment: Positive

Text: It doesnt work! Sentiment:
```


- **Zero-shot prompting**: Use this when the task is simple, well-understood, or frequently encountered in the model’s training data. It’s efficient for tasks like basic arithmetic, general queries, or sentiment classification for common phrases.
	
- **One-shot prompting**: This is helpful for tasks that need more specific guidance or when the model struggles with ambiguity. Providing a single example can clarify the task, improving accuracy in tasks like basic classification or structured information extraction.
	
- **Few-shot prompting**: Best used for complex tasks requiring multiple examples to establish patterns. This technique is ideal for tasks that involve varied inputs, require precise formatting, or demand a higher degree of accuracy, such as generating structured outputs or handling nuanced classifications.

# Introduction to Prompt Engineering 
Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting effective prompts to guide AI systems in generating the desired output. In essence, **the quality of an AI's output is heavily influenced by the quality of the prompt** . Generative AI models produce specific outputs based on the prompts they are given​[IBM.COM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/prompt-engineering#:~:text=Generative%20artificial%20intelligence%20,simple%20to%20the%20highly%20technical) , and *"the basic rule is that good prompts equal good results"*​[IBM.COM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/prompt-engineering#:~:text=queries%2C%20from%20the%20simple%20to,the%20highly%20technical) . Well-designed prompts help the AI better understand the user's intent and reduce confusion or irrelevant answers. This practice has become **essential for creating better AI-powered services and minimizing biased or incorrect outputs** ​[TECHTARGET.COM](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/prompt-engineering#:~:text=Why%20is%20prompt%20engineering%20important,to%20AI) .**Significance and Benefits:**  A thoughtfully engineered prompt bridges the gap between a user's question or task and a meaningful, accurate AI-generated response. By fine-tuning prompts, we can **optimize the relevance and quality of outputs while saving time on editing** ​[IBM.COM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/prompt-engineering#:~:text=A%20thoughtful%20approach%20to%20creating,in%20achieving%20the%20desired%20outcomes) ​[IBM.COM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/prompt-engineering#:~:text=The%20primary%20benefit%20of%20prompt,processing) . In other words, a clear and detailed prompt can produce an answer that needs little to no revision. This not only improves efficiency but also ensures the AI's response aligns with the desired goals. Effective prompting allows AI systems to tackle a wide range of queries – from simple requests to highly technical problems – with greater precision. As a result, **well-crafted prompts lead to more relevant, accurate, and personalized responses** ​[IBM.COM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/prompt-engineering#:~:text=ChatGPT%20is%20the%20better%20tool,AI%20more%20efficient%20and%20satisfying) ​[IBM.COM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/prompt-engineering#:~:text=primary%20design%20function.%20Well,AI%20more%20efficient%20and%20satisfying) , making interactions with AI more productive and satisfying.

# Core Components of a Good Prompt 
A good prompt is typically composed of several key components. Including these components helps provide the AI with clarity on *who it should emulate, what it should do, and how to deliver the answer*. Below are the core elements of a well-crafted prompt and what each contributes:
### Persona 
**Definition:**  The persona defines *the role or perspective* the AI should adopt. By assigning a role (e.g. *"You are a helpful librarian"*), we guide the AI's tone, style, and level of expertise. Persona-based instructions prime the model to respond as if it has a certain background or personality​[LEARNPROMPTING.ORG](https://learnprompting.org/docs/advanced/zero_shot/role_prompting?srsltid=AfmBOop_N3DGrH-Ua29HCgBdWs83n2pUnv4ZmsoMxDiPhHjpD08zAeEy#:~:text=,performance%20in%20reasoning%20and%20explanation) .**Significance:**  Setting a persona helps tailor the response to a specific style or domain. For example, telling the AI *"Act as a cybersecurity expert"* will likely yield a more technical and precise answer than a general response. The persona influences the vocabulary, tone, and depth of explanation. This ensures the answer is appropriate for the context – a **doctor persona will explain medical concepts calmly and factually** , whereas a **comedian persona might use humor** . In short, persona prompts align the AI’s response style with the user’s needs or the desired point of view​[LEARNPROMPTING.ORG](https://learnprompting.org/docs/advanced/zero_shot/role_prompting?srsltid=AfmBOop_N3DGrH-Ua29HCgBdWs83n2pUnv4ZmsoMxDiPhHjpD08zAeEy#:~:text=,performance%20in%20reasoning%20and%20explanation) ​[HELP.FORMALOO.COM](https://help.formaloo.com/en/articles/9797669-how-to-write-effective-ai-prompts#:~:text=Persona%3A%20Defines%20the%20role%20or,to%20match%20the%20response%20style) .**Example:**  *"You are a knowledgeable historian. Explain the significance of the Industrial Revolution in a neutral, informative tone."* – Here the persona "knowledgeable historian" sets an expectation for an academic and factual answer.
### Context 
**Definition:**  Context provides background information or details that frame the task. It includes any relevant facts, situational details, or prior information the AI should know before addressing the main task. Essentially, context **supplies the setting or facts**  the AI needs to produce a relevant answer​[HELP.FORMALOO.COM](https://help.formaloo.com/en/articles/9797669-how-to-write-effective-ai-prompts#:~:text=Task%3A%20Specifies%20the%20action%20or,the%20AI%20needs%20to%20accomplish) .**Significance:**  Providing context helps prevent misunderstandings or generic answers. The AI uses this background to disambiguate the request. Without enough context, the model may have to guess at what you mean. With clear context, it can ground its response in the specifics you care about. However, it's important to strike a balance – include **enough relevant detail**  for clarity, but avoid irrelevant or excessive information that might confuse the model​[COMMUNITY.OPENAI.COM](https://community.openai.com/t/a-guide-to-crafting-effective-prompts-for-diverse-applications/493914#:~:text=2,on%20who%20will%20interact%20with) . Context can be a brief scenario, a passage of text to refer to, or any pertinent detail (for example, specifying the audience or the domain of the question).**Example:**  *"Context: Last quarter, our company experienced a 15% decline in sales in the European market."* – Providing this context before a question helps the AI focus its analysis or advice on that specific situation.
### Task 
**Definition:**  The task is a **clear directive or question**  – it defines *what* you want the AI to do. This could be answering a question, performing an action like translating, summarizing, writing an email, etc. It is the core instruction in the prompt​[HELP.FORMALOO.COM](https://help.formaloo.com/en/articles/9797669-how-to-write-effective-ai-prompts#:~:text=Persona%3A%20Defines%20the%20role%20or,to%20match%20the%20response%20style) .**Significance:**  A well-defined task ensures the AI knows exactly what output is expected. Vague tasks lead to vague answers, so it’s crucial to be specific and unambiguous. Phrasing the task in a straightforward way (and as a direct request or command) often works best. If the task is complex, it can help to break it into sub-tasks or step-by-step instructions. Clearly stating the task focuses the model’s efforts on the desired outcome and avoids off-topic or unnecessary content.**Example:**  *"Task: Analyze the sentiment of the following customer review."* – This explicitly tells the AI its job is to determine sentiment.
### Format 
**Definition:**  Format specifies the desired **structure or presentation**  of the output. This can include the layout (e.g. bullet points, a table, an essay), length, style guidelines, or file format (JSON, XML, etc.) expected in the response​[HELP.FORMALOO.COM](https://help.formaloo.com/en/articles/9797669-how-to-write-effective-ai-prompts#:~:text=Task%3A%20Specifies%20the%20action%20or,the%20AI%20needs%20to%20accomplish) .**Significance:**  By defining the format, you guide the AI on how to deliver the information. This is especially useful if you need the answer in a certain form – for instance, a list of steps, a formal letter, or a JSON object with specific fields. Including format instructions helps avoid back-and-forth where you have to ask the AI to reformat. It also improves clarity; the AI will organize its output as instructed, making it easier for you to read or use. Examples of format instructions include: *"Provide the answer in three bullet points,"* or *"Give the response as if it were a newspaper article."***Example:**  *"Format: Provide your answer as a numbered list of 3 points."* – This tells the AI to structure its output in a specific list format.
### References (Examples, Data, Constraints) 
**Definition:**  In the context of prompt design, "references" refers to any **supplementary information or constraints**  you include to guide the AI. This might be example inputs/outputs, data sets, quotes from source material, or specific requirements the answer must adhere to. Essentially, these are materials or rules *within the prompt* that the AI should use when composing its response.**Significance:**  Supplying relevant examples or data points can dramatically refine the AI's output. When you give the model concrete references – for instance, a few lines from an article, a sample solution, or specific data – you ground its response in that information. This reduces guesswork and increases accuracy, as the AI has less uncertainty about what content or style is expected. Similarly, stating constraints (e.g. *"limit your answer to 100 words"* or *"do not mention politics"*) helps narrow the response to your needs. Including such references and constraints makes prompts more specific and *enhances the relevance and precision of the AI’s reply*​[LAUNCHCONSULTING.COM](https://www.launchconsulting.com/posts/crafting-the-perfect-ai-prompts-the-anatomy-of-an-effective-ai-prompt-common-pitfalls#:~:text=,metrics%2C%20or%20parameters) .**Example:**  *"Reference: According to the attached data, 60% of respondents preferred option A. Use this fact in your analysis."* – By giving this fact, we expect the AI to incorporate it into its answer, making the response more informed.
### Evaluation 
**Definition:**  Evaluation is the process of **reviewing and assessing the AI's output**  against your expectations. While not part of the prompt text itself, evaluation is a critical component of prompt engineering as a practice. It involves checking the response for correctness, completeness, relevance, tone, and format.**Significance:**  After the AI provides an answer, evaluating that response tells you whether your prompt was effective or needs adjustment. Key questions in evaluation include: Did the AI follow the instructions (task, format, persona)? Is the content accurate and on-topic? Does it solve the intended problem? This step may involve testing the prompt with multiple inputs or comparing the output against a rubric or desired criteria. **Assessing the AI's response**  is crucial to determine if the prompt needs refining​[COMMUNITY.OPENAI.COM](https://community.openai.com/t/a-guide-to-crafting-effective-prompts-for-diverse-applications/493914#:~:text=4,ready%20to%20adapt%20as%20needed) . In a professional setting, evaluation might also include user feedback or quantitative metrics (e.g. accuracy rates). By systematically evaluating outputs, prompt engineers can identify weaknesses in the prompt or misunderstandings by the model.**Example:**  After getting an answer, one might evaluate: *"The summary is missing two key points from the text – I need to include those. Also, the tone is a bit too casual compared to the formal style I wanted."* This evaluation notes issues to fix in the next iteration.
### Iteration 
**Definition:**  Iteration is the **process of refining a prompt through repeated trials** , tweaking phrasing and content to improve the AI's responses. It involves analyzing results from one prompt version, adjusting the prompt, and trying again, possibly multiple times. Rather than expecting a perfect answer on the first try, iteration embraces gradual improvement​[HELP.OPENAI.COM](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10032626-prompt-engineering-best-practices-for-chatgpt#:~:text=Iterative%20refinement) .**Significance:**  Even with a good understanding of prompt principles, it's common to refine prompts to get the best results. Small changes – such as rewording a sentence, adding a detail, or reordering components – can significantly alter the output. **Prompt engineering is often an iterative process** : you start with an initial prompt, observe the outcome, and then *rework the prompt based on how the AI responded*​[HELP.OPENAI.COM](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10032626-prompt-engineering-best-practices-for-chatgpt#:~:text=Iterative%20refinement) . Through iteration, you converge on a prompt that reliably yields the desired output. This approach saves time in the long run, as each refinement brings you closer to an optimal prompt for that task.**Effective Iteration Strategies:**  When a prompt's output isn't quite right, consider these tactics to refine it: 
- **Revisit and Expand Context:**  If the answer was lacking specificity or missed the point, check if the prompt provided enough context. You might need to add background information or clarify the scenario so the AI has more guidance. For example, if an answer was too generic, include a fact or detail the AI should consider.
 
- **Break Instructions into Simpler Steps:**  Long or complex instructions can confuse the model. Try breaking a complex task into a sequence of smaller, clear instructions (even numbering them as step 1, 2, 3) rather than one long paragraph. This can guide the AI to handle each part in order​[HELP.OPENAI.COM](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10032626-prompt-engineering-best-practices-for-chatgpt#:~:text=Provide%20step) . Short, direct sentences are easier for the model to parse correctly than compound or abstract directives.
 
- **Rephrase for Clarity:**  Sometimes just wording the request differently can help. Use straightforward language and make sure each sentence in the prompt has a single, clear meaning. If a term could be interpreted in multiple ways, choose a more precise term or add an explanation. Avoid pronouns or references that might be ambiguous. Essentially, *eliminate ambiguity* wherever possible.
 
- **Add or Adjust Constraints:**  If the output was too long, off-tone, or included something unwanted, add constraints or guidelines. This could mean specifying a length limit, a required tone (e.g. "professional tone"), or explicitly saying what not to do (e.g. "Do not mention X"). Constraints act as guardrails that keep the AI's response within acceptable bounds​[LAUNCHCONSULTING.COM](https://www.launchconsulting.com/posts/crafting-the-perfect-ai-prompts-the-anatomy-of-an-effective-ai-prompt-common-pitfalls#:~:text=,metrics%2C%20or%20parameters) .
 
- **Use Examples (Few-Shot):**  If clarity is still an issue, consider giving a small example in the prompt of what you expect (more on this in *Shot-Based Prompting* below). A single example can often clarify the pattern or style you want.
 
- **Iterate Gradually:**  Change one aspect at a time and see how it affects the output. This way, you can isolate which prompt changes have which effects. Over several iterations, you'll hone in on a version that yields the best result consistently. Remember that iteration is normal – *effective prompting is rarely one-and-done*, and even experts tweak their prompts multiple times for complex tasks​[LAUNCHCONSULTING.COM](https://www.launchconsulting.com/posts/crafting-the-perfect-ai-prompts-the-anatomy-of-an-effective-ai-prompt-common-pitfalls#:~:text=An%20Iterative%20Process) .

# Types of Prompting 

There are various techniques in prompt engineering designed to coax the best performance from AI models. Different situations call for different prompting styles. Here, we outline several major types of prompting, along with what they entail:

### Instruction Prompting 
This is the simplest and most direct form of prompting: giving a clear instruction or query in natural language and expecting the model to comply. With instruction prompting, you **tell the AI exactly what you want**  in a straightforward manner. For example: *"Translate the following sentence into French:"* or *"List three benefits of exercise."* There is no special context or persona provided beyond the task itself. The model is expected to interpret the command and produce the answer. Instruction prompting is essentially *zero-shot* by default (no examples given, just a request). The key is to **state the request clearly and explicitly** . This method works well for many general tasks, especially if they are commonly seen in the model’s training data (like general knowledge Q&A or basic transformations). When using instruction prompts, it's important to avoid vagueness – the more specific and concrete the instruction, the better the output.
### Role-Based Prompting 
Role-based prompting (also known as **persona prompting** ) involves instructing the AI to adopt a specific role, character, or style. In these prompts, you explicitly say "You are X..." or "Act as a Y..." to set the context. For instance: *"You are a legal advisor. Answer the question in a formal tone,"* or *"Act as a friendly customer service agent..."*. By **assigning the AI a persona** , you guide the style, tone, and focus of its response​[LEARNPROMPTING.ORG](https://learnprompting.org/docs/advanced/zero_shot/role_prompting?srsltid=AfmBOop_N3DGrH-Ua29HCgBdWs83n2pUnv4ZmsoMxDiPhHjpD08zAeEy#:~:text=,performance%20in%20reasoning%20and%20explanation) . This can leverage the model's knowledge of how certain roles typically speak or what expertise they have. Role-based prompts are powerful for tailoring the voice of the output. A few use cases: acting as a domain expert (doctor, engineer, historian) for technical queries, taking on a creative persona (poet, comedian) for stylistic outputs, or an instructional role (like a teacher explaining a concept). The benefit is a response more closely aligned with that persona’s perspective – for example, a response as a doctor might include medical terminology and a cautious tone, which is desirable in that context. When using role-based prompting, ensure the role is well-defined and relevant to your task. (It's also wise to avoid overly specific or sensitive personas that the model might not handle well.) Overall, this technique **enhances clarity and accuracy by aligning the response with the role's viewpoint** ​[LEARNPROMPTING.ORG](https://learnprompting.org/docs/advanced/zero_shot/role_prompting?srsltid=AfmBOop_N3DGrH-Ua29HCgBdWs83n2pUnv4ZmsoMxDiPhHjpD08zAeEy#:~:text=,performance%20in%20reasoning%20and%20explanation) .
### Prompt Chaining 
Prompt chaining is a technique where **complex tasks are broken into a sequence of multiple prompts** , each dependent on the previous one’s output. Instead of asking a single prompt to do a complicated task in one go, you chain prompts so that intermediate results are handled step by step. *In prompt chaining, the output of one prompt often becomes the input or context for the next prompt*. This creates a pipeline of reasoning or processing. For example, if the overall task is to analyze a lengthy report and then write a summary with recommendations, you might use one prompt to extract key findings from the report, and a second prompt (taking those findings as input) to generate the final summary and recommendations. Prompt chaining can improve performance on multi-step problems because it **guides the model through a structured reasoning process** . It also allows you to inspect and correct intermediate outputs. This approach is particularly useful in workflows like: first having the AI brainstorm ideas, then evaluate each idea in a follow-up prompt; or doing calculations step-by-step (first prompt: solve part A, second prompt: use that result for part B). By dividing the task, each prompt can focus on a smaller problem, reducing the chance of errors or omitted details. Prompt chaining essentially creates a logical chain of thought across multiple interactions.**Variations of Prompt Chaining:**  Two notable strategies related to prompt chaining are *Chain-of-Thought* and *Tree-of-Thought*, which encourage structured reasoning paths within or across prompts:
#### Chain-of-Thought (CoT) 
Chain-of-Thought prompting is a method of prompting the model to **generate a reasoning path step-by-step** , as if it were “thinking out loud” toward the answer. Instead of giving a direct answer, the model is encouraged (or instructed) to lay out the intermediate steps or thoughts leading to the final result. This can be done implicitly (the model decides to reason stepwise if the prompt is phrased to trigger that) or explicitly by saying something like: *"Think this through step by step."* The idea is to have the AI break down complex problems into simpler sub-problems in the response itself. CoT prompting has been shown to improve accuracy on tasks that require reasoning, arithmetic, or logical deduction​[DATACAMP.COM](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/chain-of-thought-prompting#:~:text=In%20this%20article%2C%20we%20will,to%20provide%20the%20correct%20answer) . By writing out a chain of thoughts, the model can avoid jumping to a conclusion too quickly and instead examine the components of the problem. In practice, a CoT prompt might look like: *"Explain your reasoning and then give the answer: [question]."* The model might respond with a series of logical steps followed by the conclusion. **This technique leverages a human-like approach to problem solving**  – articulating each step – which often leads to more correct and transparent answers​[IBM.COM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/prompt-engineering#:~:text=outputs%20,and%20create%20more%20accurate%20outputs) . For example, rather than directly asking "What is 24 multiplied by 16?", a CoT prompt would encourage the model to compute "24 * 16 = (24 * 10) + (24 * 6) = 240 + 144 = 384" and then answer "384".
#### Tree-of-Thought (ToT) 
Tree-of-Thought prompting is an advanced reasoning approach that extends the idea of chain-of-thought. Instead of a single linear chain of reasoning, **the model explores multiple branches of thought like a tree** . At each step, the AI might consider several possible actions or ideas, branch them out, and later evaluate which branch leads to the best answer​[ZEROTOMASTERY.IO](https://zerotomastery.io/blog/tree-of-thought-prompting/#:~:text=Instead%20of%20focusing%20on%20linear,branch%20out%20at%20each%20step) . In other words, the AI doesn't commit to one line of reasoning straight away – it tries different approaches in parallel (or sequentially) and compares outcomes, akin to a decision tree or brainstorming process. ToT is useful for tasks where there might be multiple possible paths to explore (e.g., complex planning, game strategies, or any problem where an optimal solution requires considering various options). Implementing Tree-of-Thought prompting often means you ask the model to generate several possible steps or solutions at a juncture, then have it evaluate or score them (sometimes with another prompt), and then continue down the most promising path. This can be done in a single prompt by instructing the model to consider alternative options, or through a series of prompts that manually branch and test different ideas. The process **mimics human problem-solving where we consider Plan A, Plan B, etc., before choosing a direction** ​[ZEROTOMASTERY.IO](https://zerotomastery.io/blog/tree-of-thought-prompting/#:~:text=Instead%20of%20focusing%20on%20linear,branch%20out%20at%20each%20step) . By exploring a **tree-like structure of ideas** ​[ZEROTOMASTERY.IO](https://zerotomastery.io/blog/tree-of-thought-prompting/#:~:text=Instead%20of%20focusing%20on%20linear,branch%20out%20at%20each%20step) , the AI can handle more complex decision-making tasks and potentially arrive at more robust answers than with a single chain of thought.
### Meta Prompting 
Meta prompting involves *asking the AI to analyze, critique, or refine its own responses*. It's like turning the model's attention on its prior output – a kind of **self-reflection**  step. In practice, this could be a follow-up prompt where you present the AI's last answer and ask for improvements or error-checking. For example: *"Review your previous answer and fix any errors or omissions you find."* Another approach is to directly prompt the model initially to include a self-check: *"First, give your answer, then explain if there are any weaknesses or assumptions in your answer."* The goal of meta prompting is to increase the quality and correctness of the output by leveraging the AI's own ability to evaluate content. Techniques in this category include **self-critique, self-correction, or requiring the model to output a critique before finalizing an answer** ​[PROMPTENGINEERING.ORG](https://promptengineering.org/llms-learn-humility-how-self-critique-improves-logic-and-reasoning-in-llms-like-chatgpt/#:~:text=Integral%20Role%20in%20Advanced%20Prompt,Engineering) . The benefit is that the model might catch inconsistencies or mistakes that a single-pass answer would not. For instance, after solving a math problem, a meta prompt could have the model double-check the calculation. Or in a content generation task, a meta prompt might have the model list potential improvements to its story or argument, and then implement them. Research has found that prompting a model to *critique its initial output and then refine it* can make answers more logical and reliable​[PROMPTENGINEERING.ORG](https://promptengineering.org/llms-learn-humility-how-self-critique-improves-logic-and-reasoning-in-llms-like-chatgpt/#:~:text=Self,the%20human%20iterative%20thinking%20process) . However, it's not foolproof – the model might not always identify its own errors – but it often helps to get a more polished answer. Meta prompting essentially adds an extra layer of verification or optimization by using the AI as its own reviewer.
### Shot-Based Prompting (In-Context Learning) 
Shot-based prompting refers to the practice of providing **examples within the prompt**  to guide the model, leveraging the model's ability to learn from context (also known as in-context learning). The "shots" are example input-output pairs or demonstrations of the task at hand, included right before a new query. We distinguish between: **Zero-Shot, One-Shot, and Few-Shot prompting** , based on how many examples are given: 
- **Zero-Shot Prompting:**  *No examples* are provided to the model; the prompt only contains the task instruction. The AI must rely on its pre-existing knowledge to perform the task​[LEARNPROMPTING.ORG](https://learnprompting.org/docs/basics/few_shot?srsltid=AfmBOop7bAhKjeGRA5TgT8c7mHEpFn39ptOrcu0-8Hhj-1EAyyxDKQyp#:~:text=%2A%20Zero,and%20deliver%20more%20accurate%20responses) . This is basically a direct question or command (classic instruction prompting). For instance: *"Translate 'Good morning' into Spanish."* With zero-shot, you trust the model to know what to do without seeing any sample answer. This works well if the task is straightforward or very common.
 
- **One-Shot Prompting:**  *One example* is included in the prompt before the actual query. The example shows the model what format or pattern you expect. After the example, a similar task is given for the model to solve. For example, a prompt might say: *"Example: Input: 'Hello' → Output: 'Hola'. Now translate 'Good morning'."* Here the single example ("Hello" → "Hola") teaches the model the desired task (translating English to Spanish) and format, and then the model is asked to do it for a new phrase. One-shot prompting can significantly clarify the task for the AI with just one demonstration​[LEARNPROMPTING.ORG](https://learnprompting.org/docs/basics/few_shot?srsltid=AfmBOop7bAhKjeGRA5TgT8c7mHEpFn39ptOrcu0-8Hhj-1EAyyxDKQyp#:~:text=%2A%20Zero,and%20deliver%20more%20accurate%20responses) .
 
- **Few-Shot Prompting:**  *Multiple examples* (more than one, typically 2 to 5 or even more) are provided in the prompt. These examples demonstrate various aspects of the task and what kinds of outputs are expected​[LEARNPROMPTING.ORG](https://learnprompting.org/docs/basics/few_shot?srsltid=AfmBOop7bAhKjeGRA5TgT8c7mHEpFn39ptOrcu0-8Hhj-1EAyyxDKQyp#:~:text=%2A%20Zero,and%20deliver%20more%20accurate%20responses) . The prompt then ends with a new query for the model to answer in line with the pattern. Few-shot prompting is very powerful for shaping the model's output. It gives a mini "training set" on-the-fly, allowing the model to **recognize patterns and mimic the style or approach from the examples** ​[LEARNPROMPTING.ORG](https://learnprompting.org/docs/basics/few_shot?srsltid=AfmBOop7bAhKjeGRA5TgT8c7mHEpFn39ptOrcu0-8Hhj-1EAyyxDKQyp#:~:text=%2A%20One,and%20deliver%20more%20accurate%20responses) . For instance, if you want an AI to answer questions with a certain style, you might show 3 QA pairs in that style, then ask a new question – the model will likely respond following the shown style. Few-shot is useful for tasks that are unusual or where the formatting is critical, as the examples essentially program the model's behavior for that prompt. It can greatly improve accuracy on specialized tasks by reducing ambiguity about what you want. The trade-off is that a very large prompt with many examples uses more of the model's context window, but for most cases a handful of well-chosen examples are enough.
In summary, shot-based prompting uses **in-context examples to "teach" the model**  what you want on the fly. Zero-shot uses no examples (just an instruction), one-shot uses a single example, and few-shot uses multiple examples. As a rule of thumb, simple tasks or well-known tasks often work with zero-shot, but for more complex or nuanced tasks, providing one or a few examples can lead to much better results​[LEARNPROMPTING.ORG](https://learnprompting.org/docs/basics/few_shot?srsltid=AfmBOop7bAhKjeGRA5TgT8c7mHEpFn39ptOrcu0-8Hhj-1EAyyxDKQyp#:~:text=Few,them%20to%20new%2C%20similar%20tasks) ​[LEARNPROMPTING.ORG](https://learnprompting.org/docs/basics/few_shot?srsltid=AfmBOop7bAhKjeGRA5TgT8c7mHEpFn39ptOrcu0-8Hhj-1EAyyxDKQyp#:~:text=%2A%20Zero,and%20deliver%20more%20accurate%20responses) . It's a way to supply *reference outputs* as part of the prompt itself, rather than just descriptions, allowing the model to infer the right approach from those references.

# Best Practices for Writing Effective Prompts 

Crafting a prompt is as much an art as a science. Here are some best practices to keep in mind to ensure your prompts consistently yield high-quality results:
 
- **Be Clear and Specific:**  Ambiguity is the enemy of useful AI output. Always phrase your request as clearly as possible. If there's any room for interpretation, the model might go down the wrong path. Specify *exactly* what you want, and avoid vague language. For example, rather than asking *"Tell me about renewable energy,"* you could ask *"List three advantages of solar energy over fossil fuels."* Clarity and precision in prompts lead to more accurate and relevant responses​[HELP.OPENAI.COM](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10032626-prompt-engineering-best-practices-for-chatgpt#:~:text=Be%20clear%20and%20specific) . Additionally, use concrete terms and define unusual terms if needed, so the AI isn’t guessing at your meaning.
 
- **Provide Sufficient Context:**  Make sure the prompt includes any necessary background or details about the question or task. If your question depends on a previous discussion, a scenario, or specific data, include those details (or at least summarize them in the prompt). However, be concise – include *relevant* context but don't overload the prompt with extraneous information​[COMMUNITY.OPENAI.COM](https://community.openai.com/t/a-guide-to-crafting-effective-prompts-for-diverse-applications/493914#:~:text=2,on%20who%20will%20interact%20with) . The AI uses whatever you provide to understand your request; the more pertinent information it has, the better it can tailor its answer. e.g., *"Given the following excerpt from a news article [excerpt], summarize the key point..."* is better than *"Summarize the key point,"* which leaves it unclear *what* to summarize.
 
- **Use Examples (when appropriate):**  If the task format or style is not obvious, give an example. As discussed in shot-based prompting, including a sample input-output pair can show the AI the exact pattern you expect​[HELP.OPENAI.COM](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10032626-prompt-engineering-best-practices-for-chatgpt#:~:text=This%20technique%20is%20called%20one,or%20type%20of%20response%20expected) . Even in plain instructions, you can say, "*For example, ...*" to illustrate. When requesting creative output, you might give a short example of the style or the beginning of the output. Examples are especially useful if you noticed the model didn't get it right the first time – adding a demonstration can correct its course. Just ensure your examples are correct and truly representative of what you want, as the model will try to follow them closely.
 
- **Specify Format and Constraints:**  If you need the answer in a particular format (bullet list, essay, JSON, markdown, etc.) or under certain conditions (like "no more than 200 words" or "in a humorous tone"), **state that explicitly** . Models will usually respect format instructions if clearly given. For instance, say "*Answer in a table with columns X, Y, Z*" or "*Provide 3 bullet points*". Similarly, if certain details must or must not be included, spell that out. Setting these constraints helps narrow down the space of possible answers, making it more likely you'll get what you need​[LAUNCHCONSULTING.COM](https://www.launchconsulting.com/posts/crafting-the-perfect-ai-prompts-the-anatomy-of-an-effective-ai-prompt-common-pitfalls#:~:text=,metrics%2C%20or%20parameters) . It's part of making the prompt specific.
 
- **Avoid Ambiguous or Leading Questions:**  Ensure your prompt isn't open to multiple interpretations. If it is, refine it. Also, be careful with leading questions – ones that suggest a preferred answer – unless that is your intent. For example, "*Why is solar energy the best form of energy?*" presupposes it's the best; an unbiased phrasing would be "*What are the advantages and disadvantages of solar energy?*". Leading questions can bias the model’s answer to confirm the prompt's implication. If you want an objective answer, frame the question neutrally. If you want a persuasive answer for a certain position, it's okay to lead, but then you're explicitly steering the model. The key is to be conscious of how the question framing might influence the output and adjust accordingly.
 
- **Iterate and Refine:**  Don’t expect to write a perfect prompt on the first try for complex tasks. If the output isn't quite what you wanted, treat it as a learning experience. Adjust the prompt and try again – this is a normal part of prompt engineering​[HELP.OPENAI.COM](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10032626-prompt-engineering-best-practices-for-chatgpt#:~:text=Iterative%20refinement) . You might need a few attempts to get the tone right, include the necessary info, or get the conciseness you need. Each time, identify what was missing or off in the response, and tweak the prompt to address it. Sometimes a small wording change can dramatically improve the result. By iteratively refining (and possibly adding some of the techniques mentioned above like adding context or examples), you'll eventually land on a prompt that consistently delivers a good answer. Prompt design is often incremental; even experts use trial and error to hone prompts for tough problems.

By following these best practices – being clear and specific, providing context and examples, setting format expectations, and refining through iteration – you set the AI up for success. The result will be more useful, accurate, and tailored responses.

# Examples of Well-Structured Prompts 

Below are several real-world examples of prompts that illustrate different prompt engineering techniques. Each example is crafted to show how combining persona, context, task, format, and other elements leads to a clear prompt. These prompts cover use cases like email writing, article writing, summarization, and research Q&A:

### Example 1: Role-Based Instruction for an Email 
**Scenario:**  You need to write a formal apology email to a client.**Prompt:** 

```less
You are a professional customer service agent.  
Context: A customer received a damaged product and wrote a complaint. We have investigated and found it was a shipping error.  
Task: Write a polite apology email to the customer addressing the issue. Offer a replacement and a discount on their next order.  
Format: 4 short paragraphs, in a formal but empathetic tone.
```
**Explanation:** 
This prompt specifies a **persona**  ("professional customer service agent") which sets a courteous and helpful tone. It provides **context**  about the damaged product and the cause (shipping error). The **task**  is clearly stated: write an apology email with certain content (apology, offer replacement and discount). The **format**  is defined as four short paragraphs and a formal, empathetic tone. All components together guide the AI to produce a focused and appropriately styled email. The persona ensures the tone is on point, and the context ensures the email addresses the specific situation.
### Example 2: Structured Prompt for an Article Outline 
**Scenario:**  You want an AI to help outline a blog article about the benefits of remote work.**Prompt:** 

```vbnet
You are an expert business writer and editor.  
Task: Create an outline for a blog article on the benefits of remote work.  
Context: The article is aimed at corporate managers and should cover productivity, employee satisfaction, and cost savings. Latest research indicates remote teams can be more productive if managed well.  
Format: Provide the outline as a numbered list of sections and sub-points. Include at least 5 major sections with brief descriptions (1-2 sentences) for each.  
Constraints: The tone should be professional and informative (not overly casual). Do not delve into tools or technical setup, focus on concepts and benefits.
```
**Explanation:** 
In this prompt, we set a **persona**  ("expert business writer and editor") to emulate a knowledgeable, polished writing style. The **task**  is to create an article outline, and the prompt explicitly says what the topic is. The **context**  adds detail about the audience (corporate managers) and key points to include (productivity, satisfaction, cost savings, research note about productivity). The **format**  instruction asks for a numbered list outline with sections and sub-points, ensuring the output is structured as an outline. Additional **constraints**  are given about tone and scope (professional tone, avoid technical tool discussion). This prompt uses many components: it leaves little ambiguity about what the outline should contain and how it should look. The result would likely be a well-organized outline that a business writer might produce, hitting all the requested points.
### Example 3: Few-Shot Prompt for Summarization 
**Scenario:**  You have a long paragraph and want a summary. You provide an example of a summary so the AI knows the style.**Prompt:** 

```vbnet
Task: Summarize the following text in one concise paragraph.  
Format: Plain language, no bullet points, around 50 words.  
Example:  
Text: "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly evolving, with machine learning and deep learning driving advancements in healthcare, finance, and transportation. These technologies enable computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions, often surpassing human capabilities in specific tasks."  
Summary: "AI is quickly advancing through techniques like machine learning and deep learning. These innovations are allowing computers to perform tasks in areas such as healthcare, finance, and transport – sometimes with greater accuracy and speed than humans."  
  
Now, Text: "Over the past decade, remote work has transformed from a niche arrangement to a mainstream practice. Advancements in communication technology, coupled with changing workplace culture, have enabled employees to work efficiently outside traditional office settings. Studies show remote work can improve productivity, reduce overhead costs, and enhance work-life balance for employees."  
Summary:
```
**Explanation:** 
This prompt demonstrates **few-shot prompting** . It starts by clearly stating the **task**  (summarization) and desired **format**  (one paragraph, ~50 words, plain language). Then it provides an **example** : a piece of text and a summary of that text. This example acts as a reference for the AI, showing what level of detail and style the summary should have. After the example, the prompt presents a new text about remote work and leaves the **Summary:**  to be completed by the AI. The example guides the model to produce a similar concise summary for the new text. The context of including the example makes the prompt much more specific than a zero-shot request. The model can infer from the example that the summary should capture the main points (advancements enabling remote work, benefits like productivity and cost reduction, etc.) in a single paragraph. Because we gave a template to follow, we increase the chances of getting a well-formed summary for the remote work paragraph.
### Example 4: Chain-of-Thought Prompt for a Research Question 
**Scenario:**  You are asking a complex question and want the AI to reason through it step by step, possibly with a self-check at the end.**Prompt:** 

```vbnet
You are a scientific researcher and educator.  
Task: Answer the question step-by-step and then provide a final conclusion.  
Question: "How might increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels affect marine life, and what are the potential long-term implications for ocean ecosystems?"  
Format: First, think through the problem in a series of logical steps or bullet points (chain-of-thought), then give a final summary answer in a short paragraph.  
Meta: After the answer, briefly critique if the reasoning missed anything important. If something was missed, include it in the final answer.
```
**Explanation:** 
This prompt combines a few advanced techniques. The persona is a **scientific researcher** , setting an analytical and factual tone. The **task**  is to answer step-by-step and conclude, which explicitly asks for a **chain-of-thought approach** . The **format**  specifies that the answer should start with a series of logical steps or bullet points (this encourages the model to break down the reasoning about CO2 and marine life) and then provide a short concluding paragraph. The prompt even includes a **meta prompting**  element: after giving the answer, the AI is asked to critique its own reasoning and add anything that was missed. This self-critique step should help improve the completeness of the answer. The question itself is complex (impact of CO2 on marine life and long-term implications), which normally requires considering several factors (like ocean acidification, food chain effects, coral bleaching, etc.). By structuring the prompt this way, we push the model to **reason in a structured manner (CoT)**  and then *review its answer (meta/self-reflection)*. The expected output would be something like a list of bullet points (e.g., increased CO2 leads to ocean acidification -> harms shellfish; warmer oceans -> coral bleaching; disruption of food chains, etc.), and then a concluding paragraph summarizing the overall implications. Finally, a brief self-critique might say if it covered most points and perhaps add a missing point if any. This example shows how to get an AI to not only produce an answer but to outline its reasoning and double-check itself, which is very useful for complex research questions.

---

Each of these examples demonstrates how **structured prompts**  can vastly improve the quality of AI outputs. By clearly defining roles, providing context, outlining tasks, specifying formats, and even giving examples or meta-instructions, we reduce ambiguity and guide the AI to deliver exactly what we need. Effective prompt engineering, as shown, is about being explicit and detailed *up front*, so that the AI can do its job in one go, with minimal corrections. By applying the techniques and principles from this guide – using personas, context, well-defined tasks, format instructions, references, and iterative refinement – you can interact with AI models more efficiently and obtain high-quality results consistently. Prompt engineering is a skill that grows with practice, but with the structured approach outlined above, anyone can start crafting better prompts and unlock more of their AI's potential.
