**Dear Neighbor(s),**

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to kindly address an ongoing issue regarding the noise levels during late evening and early morning hours. Unfortunately, the noise from your apartment has been repeatedly disrupting my sleep, making it increasingly difficult for me to rest properly.

I have exercised patience and refrained from taking action, even though this issue has been ongoing for months. However, despite this, the noise disturbances continue, and I can no longer overlook the impact it is having on my well-being.

As per our rental agreement, quiet hours are from 10:00 PM to 7:00 AM. I respectfully request that you adhere to these quiet hours in order to maintain a peaceful living environment for all residents.

If this issue persists, I will have no choice but to escalate the matter and contact the relevant authorities to file a formal complaint. I sincerely hope we can resolve this matter without further action.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]  
[Your Apartment Number]
