The  idea here is to derive a point to coin ratio. 
Points: The points users accumulate using various activities.
Coins: Currency inside the app. scales based on the point to coin rate.
Parameter: A Parameter is an activity that contributes to increase user engagement inside the app. e.g. Impressions/Clicks etc.

First we take the Yr2 profit from the income statement and divide it by 12 to get the monthly average profit.
We allocate a certain percentage of this to the users.

Users are categorized into 3 tiers: Daily, weekly and monthly. This is because the score a user gets for a parameter depends on the activity.

The total parameter count is calculated (sum of all impressions, clicks etc.)
Then Monthly allocated profit per parameter is calculated.
