JSONB is a datatype that is supported by POSTGRESQL.
B stands for binary

The main difference between JSON and JSONB is the way they store data, which affects their performance and use cases: 
- Storage: JSON stores data as plain text, while JSONB stores it in a binary format. 
- Performance: JSONB is faster to process than JSON because it doesn't require reparsing the data. However, JSON is faster for inserting data because it has a simpler parsing process. 
- Indexing: JSONB supports indexing, which can improve query performance. JSON doesn't support indexing. 
- Flexibility: Both JSON and JSONB are flexible for handling unstructured data. 
- Preserving indentation: JSON preserves the indentation of the input data, which can be useful if you need to be careful about JSON formatting. 
- Functions and operators: JSONB supports more functions and operators than JSON.
