**A Note to Myself — On the Day Ammammo Left Us**

I'm writing this now, in this moment, because I don't want these feelings to fade.

Today I heard that Ammammo passed away. And this is a note to myself—about her.

My earliest memories of her go back to my childhood. She was the head of the _Maha Gedara_—the heart and soul of what we lovingly called _Ammammolage Gedara_. She was more than just a grandmother to me. Even the name "Ammammo" felt different—rare, unique, like her. I never saw her as the conventional idea of a grandmother. She was something else. Someone special.

Her kindness was unwavering. It never depended on who you were or what you had done. She gave without expecting anything in return. She put the happiness of others before her own, always. She was never demanding, never fussy. She was strong—right up until the very end. She never liked being a burden to anyone. And I can’t recall a single time she spoke ill of someone.

Her loyalty to Seeya stood out to me all my life. She never disrespected him, never challenged his word. Even in her final days, she would wait until Seeya had eaten before having her own meal.

Her consistency amazed me. Every single day, she lit the _Budu Pahana_ without fail. She never took a day off from her duties. Not once.

I saw these things. I learned from them. And I know—whether I recognize it or not—that she's a part of who I am today.

I just feel sad that I never got to tell her how much I appreciated her. But I’m grateful she’s no longer in pain.

Ammammo… I truly would have loved to have you as my grandmother through every lifetime. But now, more than anything, I hope you attain the **Supreme Bliss of Nibbana**. You deserve that peace. You truly do.
