I had a conversation with Sanjaya about ragging—a topic he had already discussed with Fadil. From the beginning, his tone carried aggression. His ego surfaced, and the exchange quickly became unproductive. Rather than exploring ideas, he tried to push onto me what he had already validated for himself.

This incident made me reflect on a broader principle: **who we are internally—our drives, instincts, and attitudes—cannot be permanently hidden by any mask of personality**. Even when people try to present themselves as agreeable or diplomatic, underlying traits such as ego, competitiveness, or aggression eventually reveal themselves in pressure situations.

From an evolutionary lens, this can be understood through _The Selfish Gene_. Dawkins argues that behaviors are often strategies shaped by underlying self-interest (gene survival). What may appear as generosity or friendliness can, in some cases, be strategic—designed to win trust, extract information, or turn circumstances to personal advantage.

- **Surface Behavior vs. Core Drive**: Outward charm may function as a social strategy, but core traits (like aggression) emerge when control slips.
- **Strategic Interaction**: Behaviors can be seen as moves in a game, where individuals test others, extract information, and secure advantage.
- **Consistency of the “Selfish Core”**: No matter how one portrays themselves, self-interest has a way of asserting itself—whether subtly (manipulation) or overtly (aggression).

This episode is a reminder that interactions are rarely neutral; they often carry hidden strategies. Understanding this helps me stay alert—not just to what people say, but to the evolutionary logic that may be guiding how they behave.
