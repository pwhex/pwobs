Python:
- What are design patterns? general, reusable solutions to common problems that arise during the design and development of software. They represent best practices for solving certain types of problems and provide a way for developers to communicate about effective design solutions
- Singletons - Singleton Pattern is a design pattern (google design patterns and go to image search)
- Interfaces - is a conceptual blueprint for other classes, defining a set of methods that a class must implement. The main purpose of an interface class is to enforce a "contract" that ensures consistency and predictable behavior across different, potentially unrelated classes.
