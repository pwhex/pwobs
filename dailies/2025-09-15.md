JS was rude and disrespectful towards me:
- RR requested that I set up FLEX on the PPMS3 PC.
- I asked if it was okay for us to log in to that PC.
- With her permission, I logged in and began setting up FLEX.
- While doing so, I noticed JS starting a sweep. I went over to confirm that I hadn’t accidentally interrupted her work.
- At that point, in an aggravated tone, she said: _“Do not install FLEX on this PC—do not!”_ I found her tone and manner unnecessarily aggressive.
